# EPNS(Ethereum Push Notification Service) Code Review

### Introduction

Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS), now known as the Push Protocol, is a communication protocol designed for the web3 ecosystem. It enables cross-chain notifications and messaging for decentralized applications (dApps), wallets, and services tied to wallet addresses in an open, gasless, and platform-agnostic fashion.

The protocol was created to address the lack of a notification mechanism in web3, which often results in users missing important updates, events, actions, and more. EPNS aims to solve this issue by providing a push notification service that can notify users or wallet addresses of important updates.

### Application Workflow

- **Integration:** To integrate EPNS into your application, you need to utilize the Push SDK. This SDK offers an abstraction layer for incorporating Push protocol features into both your frontend and backend systems

- **Subscription:** Users can subscribe to EPNS channels from a frontend application. This allows them to receive notifications from the channels they choose

- **Notification Creation:** Any dApp, service, or smart contract can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform-agnostic way. The notifications are triggered when a smart contract reaches certain conditions

- **Notification Delivery:** The notifications are delivered to the user's device via the platform they are using (mobile, tablet, web, etc.). The user has full control over what notifications they receive, allowing them to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the channels that they deem fit

- **User Interaction:** The user can interact with the notification, for example, by clicking on it to open the dApp, wallet, or smart contract that sent the notification

- **Governance:** The protocol governance is intended to incentivize continued adoption of the EPNS protocol, which is achieved by providing incentives for all users involved. These incentives are given in the form of PUSH tokens

### Code Walkthrough

The EPNS protocol consists of two distinct smart contracts, namely the "EPNS Core" and the "EPNS Communicator".

EPNSCore is the core protocol contract. It handles the creation of channels, channel state cycles, and channel verification features. Channels are created by dApps or smart contracts and require a minimum fee of 50 DAI. This fee forms a fund pool that generates constant interest (AAVE aDai). The generated interest from this goes to their subscribers as per their fair share.

EPNSCommunicator is the communicator protocol contract. It is responsible for sending notifications with EPNS CommV1. Any dApp, service, or smart contract can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform-agnostic way. The notifications are triggered when a smart contract reaches certain conditions

Here is the workflow for how these contracts work together:

- A dApp or smart contract creates a channel using the EPNSCore contract. This channel is tied to a specific wallet address and can send notifications to that address.

- The dApp or smart contract sends a notification using the EPNS Communicator contract. This notification is tied to the channel created.

- The notification is delivered to the user's device via the platform they are using (mobile, tablet, web, etc.). The user has full control over what notifications they receive, allowing them to subscribe to or unsubscribe from the channels that they deem fit.

#### EPNS_CORE_V1 Contract

This contract imports several interfaces to interact with AAVE Protocol and Uniswap and it also imports some of OpenZeppelinâ€™s reusable libraries and contracts to build a secure smart contract.

##### A. IMPORTS

```
import "./interfaces/IPUSH.sol";
import "./interfaces/IADai.sol";
import "./interfaces/ILendingPool.sol";
import "./interfaces/IUniswapV2Router.sol";
import "./interfaces/IEPNSCommV1.sol";
import "./interfaces/ILendingPoolAddressesProvider.sol";

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Initializable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/SafeERC20.sol";
```

The interfaces imported are:

- **IPUSH:** This contract is used to interact with the PUSH token contract. The PUSH token is a utility token used by the Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) to reward users for interacting with the platform.

- **IADai:** This contract interacts with Aave's lending pool. The redeem function is used to redeem or withdraw a certain amount of aDAI tokens from the Aave lending pool.

- **ILendingPool:** The epnscorev1 contract uses the ILendingPool interface to interact with the Aave lending protocol in order to manage the liquidity of PUSH tokens and generate revenue for the EPNS platform.
  IUniswapV2Router: The swapExactTokensForTokens function of the IUniswapV2Router interface is used in the epnscorev1 contract to swap PUSH tokens for other tokens.

- **IEPNSCommV1:** The EPNSCorev1 contract uses the subscribeViaCore function to subscribe users to channels on behalf of the EPNS platform. This allows the EPNS platform to send notifications to users about important events, such as new updates to the platform or new messages from channels that they are subscribed to.

- **ILendingPoolAddressesProvider:** The ILendingPoolAddressesProvider interface is used in the epnscorev1 contract to get the addresses of the Aave lending pool core and lending pool contracts. The epnscorev1 contract uses these addresses to interact with the Aave lending protocol.

The Openzeppelin imports are:

- **Strings.sol:** This library provides a number of functions for working with strings, such as converting strings to and from numbers, converting strings to uppercase and lowercase, and concatenating strings.

- **SafeMath.sol:** This library provides a number of functions for performing arithmetic operations safely, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- **IERC20.sol:** This interface defines the standard interface for an ERC20 token.

- **Initializable.sol:** This base contract is used to create upgradeable smart contracts.

- **SafeERC20.sol:** This library provides a number of wrapper functions for interacting with ERC20 tokens that check for success and revert on error. This can help to prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities in your Solidity contracts.

##### B. ENUMS

```
// For Message Type
enum ChannelType {
    ProtocolNonInterest,
    ProtocolPromotion,
    InterestBearingOpen,
    InterestBearingMutual
}
enum ChannelAction {
    ChannelRemoved,
    ChannelAdded,
    ChannelUpdated
}
```

**ChannelType:** This enum is used in this contract to determine the type of channel that is being created or interacted with. The type of channel determines a number of factors, such as the following: ProtocolNonInterest, ProtocolPromotion, InterestBearingOpen, InterestBearingMutual

**ChannelAction:** enum is used in the epnscorev1 contract to represent the different actions that can be performed on a channel. These actions are: ChannelRemoved, ChannelAdded, ChannelUpdated

##### G. FUNCTIONS

**Function `initialize()`**

The initialize() function in the EPNS CORE V1 contract is a special function that is used to initialize the contract when it is first deployed. This function can only be called once, and it is used to set up the contract's initial state.

The initialize() function performs the following tasks:

- Sets up the contract's addresses.
- Sets the contract's fees and other parameters.
- Returns a boolean value once all the values are initialized successfully.

Here is a detailed explanation of what each step does:

**Sets up the contract's addresses.**

The initialize() function sets up the contract's addresses by storing the following values in the contract's state:

- pushChannelAdmin: The address of the Push channel admin.
- governance: The address of the governance contract.
- daiAddress: The address of the DAI token contract.
- aDaiAddress: The address of the aDAI token contract.
- WETH_ADDRESS: The address of the WETH token contract.
- REFERRAL_CODE: The referral code for the EPNS platform.
- PUSH_TOKEN_ADDRESS: The address of the PUSH token contract.
- UNISWAP_V2_ROUTER: The address of the Uniswap V2 router contract.
- lendingPoolProviderAddress: The address of the Aave lending pool provider contract.

These addresses are used by the contract to interact with other contracts and to perform various operations.

**Sets the contract's fees and other parameters.**

The initialize() function sets the contract's fees and other parameters by storing the following values in the contract's state:

- CHANNEL_DEACTIVATION_FEES: The amount of fees that must be paid to deactivate a channel on the EPNS platform.
- ADD_CHANNEL_MIN_POOL_CONTRIBUTION: The minimum amount of PUSH tokens that must be contributed to the EPNS pool to add a new channel.
- ADD_CHANNEL_MIN_FEES: The minimum amount of fees that must be paid to add a new channel to the EPNS platform.
- ADJUST_FOR_FLOAT: A value that is used to adjust for floating-point errors.
- groupLastUpdate: The block number at which the group was last updated.
- groupNormalizedWeight: The normalized weight of the group

These fees and parameters are used by the contract to calculate various costs and determine how to distribute rewards.

**Returns a boolean value once all the values are initialized successfully.**

- The initialize() function returns a boolean value to indicate whether or not the initialization was successful. If the initialization was successful, the function will return true. Otherwise, the function will return false.

The initialize() function is a very important function in the EPNS CORE V1 contract. It is responsible for setting up the contract's initial state.

##### SETTER FUNCTONS

**updateWETHAddress():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to update the address of the Wrapped Ether (WETH) contract. The WETH contract is used to wrap Ether so that it can be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

**updateUniswapRouterAddress():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to update the address of the Uniswap V2 router contract. The Uniswap V2 router contract is used to swap tokens on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

**setEpnsCommunicatorAddress():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to set the address of the EPNS Communicator contract. The EPNS Communicator contract is responsible for sending and receiving notifications on the EPNS protocol.

**setGovernanceAddress():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to set the address of the Governance contract. The Governance contract is responsible for managing the EPNS protocol.

**setMigrationComplete():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to set the isMigrationComplete flag to true. This flag is used to indicate that the migration of the EPNS protocol to the new contract is complete.

**setChannelDeactivationFees():** This function allows the Governance contract to set the fees that are charged when a channel is deactivated. These fees are used to fund the development and maintenance of the EPNS protocol.

**setMinChannelCreationFees():** This function allows the Governance contract to set the minimum fees that must be paid when creating a new channel. These fees are used to fund the development and maintenance of the EPNS protocol.

**transferPushChannelAdminControl():** This function allows the Push Channel Admin to transfer control of the Push Channel Admin role to a new address. This role is responsible for managing the global channel on the EPNS protocol.
